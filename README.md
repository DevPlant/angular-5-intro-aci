Traning / Sample Project for Angular 5

## 1 - Setting it up

Download nodeJS & NPM https://nodejs.org/en/ ( 8.11.3 )
In the command-line execute npm i -g  @angular/cli@1.7.2 - This will install Angular Command Line Interface, an utility that helps you create and manage Angular projects


## 2 - Create a new Project

To create a new project simply run `ng new <project_name> --routing`
Then execute `cd <project_name>` and run `npm install` to download all dependencies.

This will setup a basic angular 5 project with one 'hello world' style component. It will also take care of test and build infrastructure.

In order to run the app execute `ng serve` and open your browser on http://localhost:4200
